Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 a data profiler task
 helps in
 ●identifying variable types
 ●identifying missing values and 1D outlier data points
 ●understanding the relationships between the various attributes
 ●and between the attributes and the target
 ●recognizing the important attributes
 ●visualizing the variable data distributions
 ●choosing a machine learning algorithm for the problem
data profiler
 a tool that
 • automatically analyses the data
 and
 • produces statistics and correlations
 • an example:  pandas profiling, now ydata profiling


things to notice from profiler analysis
 “diabetes” is a well curated and prepared dataset
 • no missing values
 • no duplicate rows
 • normalised features (except ‘target’) – what kind of normalisation?...
 what the profiler provides per variable
 • statistics
 • histogram
 • correlations (2x2) – including target variable in dataframe is helpful

some ML issues… of scikit-learn
 An example to remember:
 • decision trees don’t have any theoretical limitation on mixing types of attributes
 • however, scikit-learn internally converts all attribute values to dtype=np.float32
 ⇒ categorical attributes must first be encoded to numeric
 • classes OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder can be used for attributes

 notice: you must encode train and test data 
with the same encoder!

 • Pipeline
 • Allows the composition of several operations to be defined and called at once 
• Particularly useful for data preparation

Read data/Problem description
Read data/Problem description
 • The data is composed of 21 attribute values
 • Section 2 has the description of each attribute values:
 • Boolean values
 • Continuous values
 • Missing data (97, 98, 99)
 • 4 objectives of the two types
 • Classification
 • Regression
